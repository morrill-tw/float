          Float has several features that distinguish it from a typical cup:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Its bottom is rounded, making it impossible to set down when holding
            a drink.
          </li>
          <li>
            It features two sensors on opposite sides of the cup. When one
            sensor is covered, the cup will vibrate.
          </li>
          <li>It lacks any sort of handle.</li>
        </ul>

              In the United States, life is often fast-paced and centered around
              work. It's rare to find coffee shops and cafes that enforce no
              laptop policies, thus people often work in these spaces that
              should really be used for socialization and mindfulness.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's where Float comes in. Float totally revolutionizes the way
              that we utilize cafe spaces and transforms our everyday routines.
              Float's design features essentially prevent customers from doing
              anything but hold on to the cup with both hands by causing a
              vibrating sensation when held by only one hand, and toppling over
              when settled down. This eliminates phone and laptop usage. It
              encourages customers to be present, engage in more conversation,
              or spend time with their own thoughts. This fosters a healthier
              and more vibrant cafe experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Float can also be used in the home, encouraging mindfulness, and a
              break in one's daily routine. With the advent of social media
              platforms and new technologies like artificial intelligence, we
              spend much of our time glued to our phones, distracted, and in the
              zone. The average American spends about <strong>7 hours</strong> a
              day looking at screens. 7 hours! It's important to spend time
              reflecting on our days and our wellbeing, not drowning out our
              thoughts with endless scrolling. Float forces this kind of
              thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's a greater conversation to be had here.
              <strong
                >Why do we feel inclined to work in environments that weren't
                traditionally intended for that purpose? Why do we struggle to
                give ourselves breaks? Why do we avoid sitting with nothing but
                our own thoughts? Is that healthy?</strong
              >
              These are all important questions to ponder.

          Float went through many iterations. The beginning stages of the design
          process regarded understanding my audience, understanding my purpose,
          and getting the shape of Float right. Whenever I walk into a cafe, I
          can't help but feel frustrated with those on their laptops or phones.
          So my target audience became cafe customers. I recognize that many
          customers use cafe spaces for this purpose, doing work, so I set out
          to change that. The first few sketches pictured below show some of my
          first iterations of the product. I knew that I wanted to force cafe
          customers to hold this cup in a way that would prevent them from using
          their hands. I then dove into some of the more technical aspects of
          the cup, like charging, and how to minimize heat transfer, but I found
          this to be distracting from my main goal, to shape cafe customer
          behavior. So I continued on, and eventually got to a point where I
          started sketching logos, and drafts for this web page. The name Float
          comes from the fact that the cup cannot be placed down and alludes to
          the floating sensation that one may feel when meditating. Finally, I
          created some neater representations of the product, and its use, which
          made their way to this page.
